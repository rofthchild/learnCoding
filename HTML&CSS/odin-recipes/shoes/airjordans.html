    <h1>Air Jordan 3 "Rare Air"</h1>
    <p>
        <br>The Air Jordan 3 "Rare Air" is a sneaker that made Rofth feel like a little boy when he saw them for the first time. He had to buy them. GOT 'EM!! 
        <br>The colors screamed boyhood. A nostalgic vibe for him. When he put them on, he felt like he was transported back to his childhood.
        <br> All of the sudden: he could run <em>faster</em>, jump <em>higher</em>, and play <em>harder</em>.
